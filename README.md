MyRuns5 – Activity Recognition
Documentation, References, and AI Use Statement

Student: Navdeep Singh Bilin
Course: CMPT 362 
Project: MyRuns5
Instructor References:

	* Sensor Manager lecture (Week 10) — accelerometer, SensorEventListener, sampling
	* Activity Recognition lecture (Week 10) — magnitude → FFT → feature vector → Weka training



Special Note: 
		* Training data was collected using the MyRuns Data Collector, exported as features.arff, processed in WEKA, and the generated Java classifier was added into the project
		* A new DisplayGpsActivity screen was added to replay GPS routes with a delete button, matching the instructor demo APK, which wasn't implemented "properly" in MR4


1.) TrackingService.kt - 

	* lecture references: Sensor Manager & Activity Recognition
	* AI Assistance: used for integrating the FFT results into an array for Weka
		
		* AI wasn't used for building the system, but rather I was following the professors Activity Recog lecture

2.) FFT.java - 

	* lecture references: Activity Recognition
	* AI Assistance: none
	* Note: This file was directly taken from the MyRuns Data Collector provided by prof. it remains as a java file
		due to the copyright documentation within it, I did not want to accidentally violate it, so kept the file as is

3.) WekaClassifier.java - 

	* lecture references: Activity Recognition
	* functionality: Contains J48 decision tree class generated by WEKA for features.arff dataset
	* AI Assistance: None

4.) MapActivity.kt - 

	* edited to allow for real time activity labels from TrackingService.kt
	* light AI use for merging GPS logic with classification output

5.) DisplayGpsActivity.kt - 

	* in my MR4 lab, I did not have enough time to create the full size map entry fragment, 
	  so I decided to add that here as a separate file and corresponding XML
	* AI: None

______________
Training Phase: 

	* Tools Used: 
		MyRunsDataCollector.zip
		Weka 3.8.6 
		Trained (standing, walking, running)

	* Note: Since I dont have an android phone, I was using the emulator, and it was quite cumbersome
		trying to give real time data, my apologies if there are discrepancies

_________________
Additional Notes:

	* The Full automatic classification could not be fully evaluated due to not having a phsyical devie
	  the Emulator lacks the acclerometer needed, and the device pose wasn't much help either

	* I used a TEST_MODE for emulator simulation tests and set it to false for submission
